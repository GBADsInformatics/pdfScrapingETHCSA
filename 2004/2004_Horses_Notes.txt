Notes on the Tables produced by the Horses Pipeline - 2004

September 30, 2021

Table 3-1
 - Problem: Ethiopia's sheep and goats columns are combined, creating a large number and shift in columns
 - Action: correct the number, add to the missing column and shift the columns back in place (Goats is 14,858,646)
