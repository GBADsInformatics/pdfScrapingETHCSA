Table 3-20a
  - Problem: Some rows have no data as:
    - Row 42 "Horoguduru" is meant to be a continuation of the previous row zone
    - Row 48 "Benshangul-" is meant to be the region along with "Gumuz" from the next row for the following entries
    - Row 58 "Kembata" is meant to be a continuation of the previous row zone
    - Row 69 "Amaro Sp." is meant to be a prepended to the next row zone
    - Row 72 "Kanso Sp." is meant to be a prepended to the next row zone
    - Row 74 "Derashe Sp." is meant to be a prepended to the next row zone
    - Row 76 "Basketo Sp." is meant to be a prepended to the next row zone
    - Row 79 "Konta Sp." is meant to be a prepended to the next row zone
    - Row 82 "Alaba Sp." is meant to be a prepended to the next row zone
    - Row 84 is unnecessary and the zone "Region" in the next row is to be deleted
  - Action: Add the data to the right cells and delete the incorrect cells/rows
