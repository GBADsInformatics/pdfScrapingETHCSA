  - Action: Remove row 3 and 4 and extra " characters
  - Problem: Ethiopia data row is offset to the left
  - Action: Shift the row to the right by one

  - Action: Remove row 3, 4 and 5 and extra " characters
  - Problem: Ethiopia data row is offset to the left and missing the Ethiopia in the region column

Table 3-23c
  - Problem: Table contains 1 extra rows after the header

  - Problem: Ethiopia data row is offset to the left and missing the Ethiopia in the region column
  - Action: Shift the row to the right by one and insert approriate data
  - Problem: Extra empty column on column C
  - Action: Shift the number data 1 column to the left

Problem: Gambela Region is spelt 2 ways which causes errors:
   - Gambela region
   - Gambela
Action: The addition of 2 sed command corrects the problems that the typos cause. Replace for Gambela and then for Gambela Region.
Note: the sed commands are of the form: sed -i '' "s/Gambela region/Gambela/g" <filename> because this was developed under
Mac OS X.  On a Linux system they need to be of the form sed -i "s/Gambela region/Gambela/g" <filename>.
