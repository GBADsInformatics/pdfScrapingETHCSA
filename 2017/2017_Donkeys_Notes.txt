Notes on the Tables produced by the Donkeys Pipeline - 2017

November 10,2021

Table 3-1
 - Problem: Ethiopia row has all data columns after 4th shifted by one.
 - Action: manually re-shift back.

Table 3-5
  - Problem: first row contains combined data
  - Action: split and shift the data accordingly to the pdf

Table 3-10
  - Problem: The data values are shifted to the right by one
  - Action: Shift the data values to the left by one

Table 3-19e
  - Problem: Contains 2 extra columns after header and shifted cells
  - Action: Removed 2 extra cells after header and shifted the cells appropriately and removed extre " characters

Table 3-20e
  - Problem: Contains 2 extra columns after header and shifted cells
  - Action: Removed 2 extra cells after header and shifted the cells appropriately and removed extre " characters

Problem: Gambela Region is spelt 2 ways which causes errors:
   - Gambela region
   - Gambela
Action: The addition of 2 sed command corrects the problems that the typos cause. Replace for Gambela and then for Gambela Region.
Note: the sed commands are of the form: sed -i '' "s/Gambela region/Gambela/g" <filename> because this was developed under
Mac OS X.  On a Linux system they need to be of the form sed -i "s/Gambela region/Gambela/g" <filename>.
