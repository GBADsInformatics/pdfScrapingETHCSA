Notes on the Tables produced by the Sheep Pipeline - 2017

August 31, 2021

Table 3-20b
  - Problem: Multiple data cells have been combined and offset from the scraping
  - Action: Shift data and manually find and put correct values from the pdf.

Table 3-23b
  - Problem: Extra empty column on column C
  - Action: Shift the number data 1 column to the left

Table 3-27b
 - Problem: rows had an extra column
 - Action: remove extra column at the end

Problem: Gambela Region is spelt 2 ways which causes errors:
   - Gambela region
   - Gambela
Action: The addition of 2 sed command corrects the problems that the typos cause. Replace for Gambela and then for Gambela Region.
Note: the sed commands are of the form: sed -i '' "s/Gambela region/Gambela/g" <filename> because this was developed under
Mac OS X.  On a Linux system they need to be of the form sed -i "s/Gambela region/Gambela/g" <filename>.
