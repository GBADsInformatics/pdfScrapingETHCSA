Notes on the Tables produced by the Mules Pipeline - 2017

November 20, 2021

Table 3-1
 - Problem: Ethiopia row has all data columns after 4th shifted by one.
 - Action: manually re-shift back.

Table 3-23d
 - Problem: empty column for all rows
 - Action: remove empty column for all rows

Problem: Gambela Region is spelt 2 ways which causes errors:
   - Gambela region
   - Gambela
Action: The addition of 2 sed command corrects the problems that the typos cause. Replace for Gambela and then for Gambela Region.
Note: the sed commands are of the form: sed -i '' "s/Gambela region/Gambela/g" <filename> because this was developed under
Mac OS X.  On a Linux system they need to be of the form sed -i "s/Gambela region/Gambela/g" <filename>.
