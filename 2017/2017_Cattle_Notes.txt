Table 3-1
 - Problem: Ethiopia row has all data columns after 4th shifted by one.
 - Action: manually re-shift back.

Table 3-2
 - Problem: most of the rows have either missing data, merged columns, name cut-off, and SNNP merged with a row
 - Action: manually correct columns, look at original tables from PDF for understanding
 - Problem: Tigray is displayed as "Tigray"""
 - Action: remove the quotes

Table 3-19a
 - Problem: Ethiopia row has a merged column
 - Action: look at original table and split into two columns for values

Table 3-20a
 - Ethiopia and Oromia have merged columns
 - Action: look at original table and fix columns

Table 3-23a
 - Problem: empty column for all rows
 - Action: remove empty column for all rows

Problem: Gambela Region is spelt 2 ways which causes errors:
   - Gambela region
   - Gambela
Action: The addition of 2 sed command corrects the problems that the typos cause. Replace for Gambela and then for Gambela Region.
Note: the sed commands are of the form: sed -i '' "s/Gambela region/Gambela/g" <filename> because this was developed under
Mac OS X.  On a Linux system they need to be of the form sed -i "s/Gambela region/Gambela/g" <filename>.
