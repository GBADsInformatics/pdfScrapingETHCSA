  - Problem: Some rows have no data as:
    - Row with zone "North West" is meant to be "North West Tigray" as the zone for the data on the next row
    - Row with zone "Central" is meant to be "Central Tigray" as the zone for the data on the next row
    - Row with zone "Eastern" is meant to be "Eastern Tigray" as the zone for the data on the next row
    - Row with zone "Southern" is meant to be "Southern Tigray" as the zone for the data on the next row
    - Row with zone "Western" is meant to be "Western Tigray" as the zone for the data on the next row
    - Row with zone "Argoba" is meant to be "Argoba Special" as the zone for the data on the next row
    - Row with zone "West" is meant to be "West Harerghe" as the zone for the data on the next row
    - Row with zone "East" is meant to be "East Harerghe" as the zone for the data on the next row
    - Row with zone "South West" is meant to be "South West Shewa" as the zone for the data on the next row
    - Row with zone "Kellem" is meant to be "Kelem Wellega" as the zone for the data on the next row
    - Row with zone "Horoguduru" is meant to be "Horoguduru Wellega" as the zone for the data on the next row
  - Action: Add the appropriate text to the cells and delete the unnecessary rows
  - Problem: First data row contains combined data that causes an empty cell
  - Action: Shift the data to the appropriate cells and edit/fill the cells with the right data based on the pdf

Table 3-23c
 - Problem: Rows above region Somale have the data rows shifted one to the right
 - Action: Shifted them back one to the left

Table 3-24
 - Problem: Table 24: at bottom of first page (page 134) there was the line: "Note: Draught animals in this table refer to 
   Horses, Donkeys, and Mules." which added an extra row to the table. Thus instead of 76 lines there were 77.
 - Action: remove the extra line.
