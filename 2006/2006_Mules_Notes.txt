Notes on the Tables produced by the Mules Pipeline - 2006

November 21, 2020

Table 3-23e
 - Problem: Metekel row has a missing column
 - Action: add zero to missing column

Table 3-24
 - Problem: Table 24: at bottom of first page (page 133) there was the line: "Note: Draught animals in this table refer to 
   Horses, Donkeys, and Mules." which added an extra row to the table. Thus instead of 75 lines there were 76.
 - Action: remove the extra line.
