Notes on the Tables produced by the Poultry Pipeline - 2014

August 17, 2021

Table 3-22c
 - Problem: Last row with Oromia as the region is an extra row
 - Action: Delete the row (above the first Somale region row) which has blank data cells

Table 3-24
 - Problem: Table 24: at bottom of first page (page 134) there was the line: "Note: Draught animals in this table refer to 
   Horses, Donkeys, and Mules." which added an extra row to the table. Thus instead of 76 lines there were 77.
 - Action: remove the extra line.
