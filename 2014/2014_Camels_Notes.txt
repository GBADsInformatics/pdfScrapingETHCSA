Notes on the Tables produced by the Camels Pipeline - 2014

September 03, 2021

Table 3-6
 - Problem: Some rows contain empty data cells because the rows were shifted up
 - Action: Shift the rows from SNNP to Alaba Sp. Wereda down by one and add the correct data to SNNP 
	   and shift the rows from Gambela region to Mezhenger down by one add the correct data to Gambela Region

Table 3-23d
 - Problem: Data rows above Somale are shifted to the right by one
 - Action: Shift them to the left by one cell
 - Problem: Missing :row for Horoguduru Wellega after Kelem Wellega 
 - Action Add the row with data from the pdf


Table 3-24
 - Problem: Table 24: at bottom of first page (page 134) there was the line: "Note: Draught animals in this table refer to 
   Horses, Donkeys, and Mules." which added an extra row to the table. Thus instead of 76 lines there were 77.
 - Action: remove the extra line.
