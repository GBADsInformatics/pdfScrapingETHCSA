Notes on the Tables produced by the Goats Pipeline - 2014

September 01, 2021

Table 3-20c
  - Problem: Some rows have no data as:
    - Row with zone "North West" is meant to be "North West Tigray" as the zone for the data on the next row
    - Row with zone "South West" is meant to be with "South West Shewa" as the zone for the data on the next row
  - Action: Add the appropriate text to the cells and delete the unnecessary rows
  - Problem: First data row contains merged cells and empty cell due to this
  - Action: Shift the cells to the correct place and edit the data based on the pdf

Table 3-23c
 - Problem: Data rows above region Somale have the data rows shifted one to the right
 - Action: Shifted them back one to the left

Table 3-24
 - Problem: Table 24: at bottom of first page (page 134) there was the line: "Note: Draught animals in this table refer to 
   Horses, Donkeys, and Mules." which added an extra row to the table. Thus instead of 76 lines there were 77.
 - Action: remove the extra line.
