Notes on the Tables produced by the Mules Pipeline - 2007

November 21, 2021

Table 3-1
 - Problem: Two rows are offset
   - Row 57 is offset because column D has a * that should be in the next column and not combined.
   - Row 81 is offset because there is a - that was not recognised by the api on column F
 - Action: Put the data in the right column. Remove the * and - and replace -1 and 0 respectively.

Table 3-23d
 - Problem: Argoba Special, Bench Maji, and Asosa row is missing most columns
 - Action: change all missing values to 0

Table 3-24
  - Problem: The note at the bottom of the pdf page appears in row 42 of the table
  - Action: Delete the row with the note

Argoba Special is spelt "Argoba S. W." for a lot of years, added sed command to pipeline as fix
