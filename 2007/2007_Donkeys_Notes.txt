Notes on the Tables produced by the Donkeys Pipeline - 2007

November 11, 2021

Table 3-1
 - Problem: Two rows are offset
   - Row 57 is offset because column D has a * that should be in the next column and not combined.
   - Row 81 is offset because there is a - that was not recognised by the api on column F
 - Action: Put the data in the right column. Remove the * and - and replace -1 and 0 respectively.

Table 3-5
 - Problem: "Pawe Specila" is misspelled in region column
 - Action: replace "Pawe Specila" with "Pawe Special"
