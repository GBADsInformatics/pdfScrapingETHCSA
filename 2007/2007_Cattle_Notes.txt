Notes on the Tables produced by the Cattle Pipeline - 2007

July 9, 2021

Table 3-1
 - Problem: Two rows are offset
   - Row 57 is offset because column D has a * that should be in the next column and not combined.
   - Row 81 is offset because there is a - that was not recognised by the api on column F
 - Action: Put the data in the right column. Remove the * and - and replace -1 and 0 respectively.

Table 3-19a
  - Problem: last number contains no data because it was very close to the previous row in the pdf file
  - Action: Manually enter last column numbers.

Table 3-20a
  - Problem: Some rows have no data as:
    - Row 42 "Horoguduru" is meant to be a continuation of the previous row zone
    - Row 48 "Benshangul-" is meant to be the region along with "Gumuz" from the next row for the following entries
    - Row 58 "Kembata" is meant to be a continuation of the previous row zone
    - Row 69 "Amaro Sp." is meant to be a prepended to the next row zone
    - Row 72 "Kanso Sp." is meant to be a prepended to the next row zone
    - Row 74 "Derashe Sp." is meant to be a prepended to the next row zone
    - Row 76 "Basketo Sp." is meant to be a prepended to the next row zone
    - Row 79 "Konta Sp." is meant to be a prepended to the next row zone
    - Row 82 "Alaba Sp." is meant to be a prepended to the next row zone
    - Row 84 is unnecessary and the zone "Region" in the next row is to be deleted
  - Action: Add the data to the right cells and delete the incorrect cells/rows

Table 3-24
  - Problem: The note at the bottom of the pdf page appears in row 42 of the table
  - Action: Delete the row with the note

Argoba Special is spelt "Argoba S. W." for a lot of years, added sed command to pipeline as fix
