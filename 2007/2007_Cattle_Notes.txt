Notes on the Tables produced by the Cattle Pipeline - 2007

July 9, 2021

Table 3-1
 - Problem: Two rows are offset
   - Row 56 is offset because column D has a * that should be in the next column and not combined
   - Row 80 is offset because there is a - that was not recognised by the api on column F

Table 3-19a
  - Problem: last no contains no data because it was very close to the previous row in the pdf file

Table 3-20a
  - Problem: Some rows have no data as:
    - Row 40 "Horoguduru" is meant to be a continuation of the previous row zone
    - Row 46 "Benshangul-" is meant to be the region along with "Gumuz" from the next row for the following entries
    - Row 56 "Kembata" is meant to be a continuation of the previous row zone
    - Row 67 "Amaro Sp." is meant to be a continuation of the previous row zone
    - Row 70 "Kanso Sp." meant to be a continuation of the previous row zone
    - Row 72 "Derashe Sp." is meant to be a continuation of the previous row zone
    - Row 75 "Basketo Sp." meant to be a continuation of the previous row zone
    - Row 77 "Konta Sp." is meant to be a continuation of the previous row zone
    - Row 80 "Alaba Sp." is meant to be a continuation of the previous row zone
    - Row 82 "Gambela" is meant to be the region along with Region from the next row for the following entries

Table 3-24
