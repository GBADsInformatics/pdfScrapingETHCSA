Notes on the Tables produced by the Sheep Pipeline - 2011

August 30, 2021

Table 3-20b
  - Problem: Some rows have no data as:
    - Row with zone "North West" is meant to be "North West Tigray" as the zone for the data on the next row
    - Row with zone "South West" is meant to be with "South West Shewa" as the zone for the data on the next row
  - Action: Add the appropriate text to the cells and delete the unnecessary rows
  - Problem: Last row contains empty cell due to an empty cell in the pdf and has been offset
  - Action: shift the data cells to the appropriate place based on the pdf and enter 0 on the empty cell

Table 3-23b
  - Problem: First 40 rows (excluding the header), the data has an extra empty column on column C.
  - Action: Shift the table to remove the empty column

Table 3-24
  - Problem: The note at the bottom of the pdf page appears in row 42 of the table
  - Action: Delete the row
