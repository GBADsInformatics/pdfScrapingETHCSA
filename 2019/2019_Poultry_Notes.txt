Notes on the Tables produced by the Poultry Pipeline - 2019

August 17, 2021
% wc 2019_T*.csv 

Table 3-22c
 - Problem: Last row with Oromia as the region is an extra row
 - Action: Delete the row (above the first Somale region row) which has blank data cells

Table 3-24
 - Problem: Table 24: at bottom of first page there was the line: "Note: Draught animals in this table refer to
   Horses, Donkeys, and Mules." which added an extra row to the table.  Thus instead of 93 lines there were 94.
 - Action: remove the extra line.

Problem: The region Dire Dawa Astedader is spelled three ways:
   - Dire Dawa Astedader
   - DirDawaAstedader
   - Dire Dawa Astedadar
and Harari sometimes appears as Hareri and Somale sometimes appears as Somalie.
To combat these "typos" before the addRegionsZones.py program, sed is used to find misspellings and change them
to a standard form: "Harari", "Somale", and "Dire Dawa Astedader".
Action: The addition of these sed commands corrects the problems that the typos cause.
Note: the sed commands are of the form: sed -i '' "s/Hareri/Harari/g" <filename> because this was developed under
Mac OS X.  On a Linux system they need to be of the form sed -i "s/Hareri/Harari/g" <filename>.
