Notes on the Tables produced by the Goats Pipeline - 2019

% wc 2019_T*.csv 

Table 3-4
 - Problem: data rows contain shifted element
 - Action: shift the elements to the correct position based on the pdf

Table 3-20c
 - Problem: Rows split due to zone name split on different lines on the pdf and often have last character missing
 - Action: remove empty cell rows and combine the zone names based on the pdf
 - Problem: Benshangul-Gumuz is meant to be the Region name 
 - Action: Correct the region names based on the pdf and format of the file and remove the zone of Benshangul-Gumuz

Table 3-23c
 - Problem: Rows above region Somale have the data rows shifted one to the right
 - Action: Shifted them back one to the left

Table 3-24
 - Problem: Table 24: at bottom of first page there was the line: "Note: Draught animals in this table refer to
   Horses, Donkeys, and Mules." which added an extra row to the table.  Thus instead of 93 lines there were 94.
 - Action: remove the extra line.

Problem: The region Dire Dawa Astedader is spelled three ways:
   - Dire Dawa Astedader
   - DirDawaAstedader
   - Dire Dawa Astedadar
and Harari sometimes appears as Hareri and Somale sometimes appears as Somalie.
To combat these "typos" before the addRegionsZones.py program, sed is used to find misspellings and change them
to a standard form: "Harari", "Somale", and "Dire Dawa Astedader".
Action: The addition of these sed commands corrects the problems that the typos cause.
Note: the sed commands are of the form: sed -i '' "s/Hareri/Harari/g" <filename> because this was developed under
Mac OS X.  On a Linux system they need to be of the form sed -i "s/Hareri/Harari/g" <filename>.
