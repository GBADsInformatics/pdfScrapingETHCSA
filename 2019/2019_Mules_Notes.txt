Notes on the Tables produced by the Mules Pipeline - 2019

November 20, 2021
% wc 2019_T*.csv 

Table 3-12
 - Problem: Three rows with no cell data
 - Action: Add 0's to the data cells

Table 3-20f
 - Problem: Benshangul-Gumuz supposed to be the region instead of the row with no data
 - Action: Remove extra row and add Benshangul-Gumus as the region for the appropriate rows
 - Problem: Segen Akababi is supposed to be combined with the cone name of the next row
 - Action: Delete the row and name the row Segen Akababi Hizboch
 - Problem: Last 7 rows contain missing cell data
 - Action: Add 0's to the cells

Table 3-23d
 - Problem: some of the columns are shifted by one
 - Action: manually re-shift the columns back

Table 3-24
 - Problem: Table 24: at bottom of first page there was the line: "Note: Draught animals in this table refer to
   Horses, Donkeys, and Mules." which added an extra row to the table.  Thus instead of 93 lines there were 94.
 - Action: remove the extra line.

Problem: The region Dire Dawa Astedader is spelled three ways:
   - Dire Dawa Astedader
   - DirDawaAstedader
   - Dire Dawa Astedadar
and Harari sometimes appears as Hareri and Somale sometimes appears as Somalie.
To combat these "typos" before the addRegionsZones.py program, sed is used to find misspellings and change them
to a standard form: "Harari", "Somale", and "Dire Dawa Astedader".
Action: The addition of these sed commands corrects the problems that the typos cause.
Note: the sed commands are of the form: sed -i '' "s/Hareri/Harari/g" <filename> because this was developed under
Mac OS X.  On a Linux system they need to be of the form sed -i "s/Hareri/Harari/g" <filename>.
