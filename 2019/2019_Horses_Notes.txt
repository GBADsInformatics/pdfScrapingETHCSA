Notes on the Tables produced by the Horses Pipeline - 2019

September 27, 2021
% wc 2019_T*.csv 

Table 3-20d
 - Problem: SNNP, Segen Akababi is an empty row and is supposed to be combined with with hizbock of the next row
 - Action: delete the row and make the region of the next row Segen Akababi Hizboch

Problem: The region Dire Dawa Astedader is spelled three ways:
   - Dire Dawa Astedader
   - DirDawaAstedader
   - Dire Dawa Astedadar
and Harari sometimes appears as Hareri and Somale sometimes appears as Somalie.
To combat these "typos" before the addRegionsZones.py program, sed is used to find misspellings and change them
to a standard form: "Harari", "Somale", and "Dire Dawa Astedader".
Action: The addition of these sed commands corrects the problems that the typos cause.
Note: the sed commands are of the form: sed -i '' "s/Hareri/Harari/g" <filename> because this was developed under
Mac OS X.  On a Linux system they need to be of the form sed -i "s/Hareri/Harari/g" <filename>.
